These are some simple machine learning algorithm I implemented before.<br />
Most of them are R code form school assignment.
(Don't copy & paste them as your homework!) <br />
Hope this can help beginners who are interested in R programming or ML.<br />

Models:
 - Colaborative Filtering (R)
 - Matrix Factorization (java)
 - linear regression (python)
 - logistic regression (python, R)
 - Naive Bayes (python)
 - Add SVM with SMO method (pyhton)
 - Gausian mixture model (python, PyMC)

TODO:
- add kernel functions in SVM
- add GLMNET in linear & logistic regression
