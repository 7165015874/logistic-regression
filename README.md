These are some basic machine learning algorithms I implemented for school homework or for experiment.<br />
Hope this can help beginners who are interested in R/Python programming and ML.<br />
Note: All code are NOT optimized!

Current Models:
 - Colaborative Filtering (R)
 - Matrix Factorization (java)
 - linear regression (python)
 - logistic regression (python, R)
 - Naive Bayes (python)
 - Add SVM with SMO method (pyhton)
 - Gaussian mixture model (python, PyMC)

TODO:
- kernel for SVM
- GLMNET for linear
